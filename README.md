<h1 align="center">Paradox Patcher</h1>
<h3 align="center">A Python patcher for Paradox games, like <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/hearts-of-iron-iv/about">HOI4</a> that gives you developer access to commands and more!</h3>

#### Made by rxzyx (rzx). This is purley for education purposes.
- ðŸ“« Have a problem? **Just write an issue and I will do my best to respond.**

## Features:

### HOI4
- Add developer access to commands in the console
    - This means that you can use commands like `normals`, `aircombat` and more!
    - You can see which commands can be now be used by checking the documentation/script_documentation.json file and looking at the console_commands section, where the commands that are now unlocked will have the value "available_in_release_build" set to false, you can also see unlocked commands in documentation/console_commands_documentation.html where the unlocked commands will have "Not available in release build" in them.

### EU4
- Add developer access to commands in the console
    - This means that you can use commands like `debug_smooth`
- Allow console access in Ironman mode and multiplayer

#### I am not responsible for your actions with this. Please rememeber to use these fairly.

## How To Use (Python):

- Firstly, remember to backup the original file you intend to patch.
- For how to retrieve the .app file, look up a tutorial or simply open Steam, navigate to the supported app of choice, click the Settings icon, then Manage and finally Browse local files

### MacOS
### Method 1
- To patch a Mach-O file (which can be found in hoi4.app/Contents/MacOS/hoi4 or eu4.app/Contents/MacOS/eu4), copy it into another directory, and you can then either pass the file path as an argument, like:
    - `python3 main.py path/to/macho`
- or input it when running the script. You can then replace the original Mach-O file with the patched one.

### Method 2
- Additionally, you can patch the whole .app file (same functionality as giving the Mach-O file path in the .app), but this requires root access, which can be done via:
    - `sudo python3 main.py path/to/game.app`
- The original .app file can now be replaced with the patched one this way.

- I would really appreciate some pull requestsâ€”whether for style, logic, efficiency, or features. Anything would be helpful!

### Windows
### .exe files
- .exe is not yet supported for EU4, however, it is as of now supported for HOI4.
- Simply use the script as normal but input a .exe as the path, this will be patched and you can replace the original file with it.
- However, it hasn't actually been tested properly, so feedback will be appreciated!


## ðŸ¤– Features with Problems:

- Patching the hoi4.exe file has not been tested. Feedback will be appreciated, you can submit an error in the "Issues" section. Make sure to backup the original file.
